    Understanding Chuukese

Ran annim!

This site is my collection of notes on understanding the Chuukese language of Micronesia. Here are some places to start:

* Colors_
* Counting_
* Pronouns_
* Possessives_
* Demonstratives_

I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, often referred to as "Mormons". Included in this site are notes on words and phrases used in our church services and our scriptures, such as The Book of Mormon (Ewe Puken Mormon in Chuukese).

* Mormon_
* Scripture_

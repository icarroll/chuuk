Ran annim! Good day!

* `Useful Phrases`_
* Colors_
* Counting_
* Pronouns_
* Tenses_
* Possessives_
* Demonstratives_

I am a member of `The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints`_, often referred to as "Mormons_". Included in this site are notes on words and phrases used in our church services; and our scriptures, such as `The Book of Mormon`_ (Ewe Puken Mormon in Chuukese).

* `Mormon Vocabulary`_
* `Scripture Notes`_
